# TezPool
TezPool is an opensource redistribution software for tezos baking pools.


## Configuration
The software is configured by modifying the ```config.json``` file.

- host: the host of your node; if you run the pool in the same server of the node, leave "http://127.0.0.1:8732"
- pkh: publickeyhash of the delegate
- name: name of your pool
- percentage: % of tezos to distribute
- payto: could be "contract" if you want to pay rewards to KT addresses, or "manager" if you want to pay reward to tz addresses
- deleguees: a dictionary with "address": "alias"
- private: true if you want to split the reward only between addresses defined in deleguees
- startcycle: the cycle when your delegate started to be a baker
- payout: a json object containing payment configuration

### payout configuration

We will implement many method for payout; the only implemented at the moment, called 'tezos-client', generates bash strings for sending 
transactions manually.

- method: payment method (only tezosclient supported atm)
- minpayout: the minimum amount to pay


## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dakk/tezpool
cd tezpool
apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install requests
```

Remove my private pool data and logs:

```bash
rm -r ./paylog.json ./docs/paylog.json ./docs/data.json
```

## Usage

```bash
usage: tezpool.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-cc cycle] action

Tezos delegate redistribution script

positional arguments:
  action                action to perform (updatedocs, updatependings, paypendings)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json, --config config.json
                        set a config file (default: config.json)
```

### Cycle snapshots and data update
Update the docs; this command will update the frontend with future cycles and reward estimation:

```bash
python3 tezpool.py updatedocs
```

### Update pending reward
Update the frozen / pending reward for deleguees; it will edit/generate a file called paylog.json 
and data/paylog.json which contains pool payment data:

```bash
python3 tezpool.py updatependings
```

### Pay rewards
Pay pending reward (unfrozen rewards); it will edit paylog.json and data/paylog.json subtracting pending 
reward and sending transactions to delegators. The behaviour of the commands depends on the payout method
specified in the config.json file: at the moment only the tezos-client method is available.

```bash
python3 tezpool.py paypendings
```

#### tezos-client method
After updating paylog.json, it generates a file called payouts.sh; it contains tezos-client command
to pay for each deleguees reward. 


### Update 
For every new cycle you have to run both updatedocs and updatependings, and upload the new frontend data.


## Frontend
The docs/ folder contains a tiny frontend for the pool statistics; you have to run the updatedocs action in order to keep the frontend updated.

### Terms

- Estimated reward: reward value estimated for a future cycle
- Frozen reward: reward of blocks already baked / endorsed, but still frozen for 5 cycles (PRESERVED_CYCLES)
- Pending reward: reward value unfrozen, but pending redistribution among deleguees
- Paid reward: reward value unfrozen and redistributed among deleguees
